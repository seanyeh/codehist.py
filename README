codehist.py

Tool to generate visualizations of source code (or any kind of text file)
history.

Demo: http://codehistdemo.seanyeh.com

Dependencies:
    python3 (python2 might work with minimal/no changes, though I haven't tried it)
    patch
    vim (for converting source code -> html)
    wkhtmltoimage (optional: for converting to image)
    ffmpeg (optional: for converting to video)

Usage:
Probably the easiest way to use this is to first generate incremental patch
files of the file history using the vim plugin codehist.vim
(https://github.com/seanyeh/codehist.vim), assuming you use vim.

Run:
    python codehist.py DIR_WITH_DIFFS OUTPUT_DIR


codehist.py will turn your diffs -> files (an individual file for each history
'version') -> html -> JSON. This JSON file has all the data for each version of the
history, and can be used with some html/javascript to produce a simple
visualizer. An example of such a visualizer can be found in the examples
directory, or see http://codehistdemo.seanyeh.com for a demo visualization
of the history of codehist.py :)


Currently, the conversion from files -> html is done by vim's TOhtml because I
am happy with my current vim color scheme, but using a different syntax
highlighting tool such as pygments could probably be done with some minor
changes.

codehist.py can also generate images of each frame and a video of the history,
though the results are not as nice for files with many lines (because the video
would have a really large height).
